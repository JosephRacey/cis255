	<br> I belive that having a policy that doesn't allow for cross origin fetching is a decent idea because it allows for more security, <br>
	and more reliability, unless you change something about the data that it's pointed at it wont be tampered with or unexpectedly changed. <br>
	However it does mean that it is a lot less flexible than if it were to have a cross origin policy. <br> 
	I'm sure there are workarounds that I don't really know about but that just means more unneeded complexity. 
	<br>As for using callback functions to change the color of alternating lines, I can't really say if its the best way because I was unable to get it to work.
